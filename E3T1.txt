# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

AWS GuardDuty had 2 specific findings in context of SSH brute forcing:
First that one of my instances was being "used" to perform an SSH brute force attack on another instance (low severity).
And second that one of my instances was being "attacked" by an SSH brute force attack (high severity)

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

From official AWS documentation:
Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes data from VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs.
The details for this attack have be found in the "VPC flow logs" that are being written to S3 (one of the non-recipe buckets we created in the first exercise).
Those log files show a large amount of requests being sent from the one instance to a specific IP indicating that the instance is being used for an SSH brute force attack.
The logs will also show a large amount of requests sent to the instance from a specific IP indicating that this specific instance is being attacked by a SSH brute force attack.
