# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
First, remove all external access to the instances. 
Then configure AWS Systems Manager and require any ssh to the instances be done through it (bastion host like configuration).


# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
If IAM permissions are not changed, VPC endpoints alone would not prevent any unauthorized access to the secret recipes S3bucket.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, when activation the default encryption a message pops up that informs that all data available will not be encrypted in retrospective. 
This means only files added after default encryption activation will be encrypted.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
CloudFormation is an Infrastructure-as-Code tool that uses a descriptive language. It defines the "final" state of the environment.
This means that all changes that have been made manually would be reverted back to the state that is described in the cloudformation template.
