Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1

There are no restrictive ACL rules configured, thus all traffic is allowed (on all ports from all ports) for public and private subnets. 

Network ACL rules should be used to minimise the available network connectivity to reduce the traffic that can be sent to and from the subnet. 
A network access control list (ACL) is an optional layer of security within a VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic that flows in and out of one or more subnets. 
This will shrink the attack surface and the ability for malicious actions that canbe performed. This allows to keep the private subnet (and its contents) private.

# Poor practice 2

All created S3 buckets (including the bucket for VPC flow logs) have no server-side encryption enabled.
All files were uploaded without initial encryption and all the buckets have block public access disabled.
Without encryption and public access, it might be easy for attackers to gain access to the bucket contents. 
Furthermore the vpc-flow-logs may contain information that could help attackers to gain even more inisghts to further compromise the infrastructure if any security flaws are detected.
