Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.


For the AttackInstanceSG:
Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 to block access to the instance via SSH over the internet

For the WebAppSG:
Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22/3389 to block access to the instance via SSH or RDP over the internet

In general it is a best security practice to ensure that the default security group of every VPC restricts all traffic by default.
Only ports and traffic should be allowed that are required for functionality (comparable to least privilege approach)


Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Make usage of specific IP-Addresses or ranges that are allowed for connections (e.g. public IP of Admin only).
This ensure attackers cannot gain access to the machine/instance even if the compromised access keys or credentials.
