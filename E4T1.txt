# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

#1
Restrict network traffic that can reach the application server via security groups and ACLs
#2
Configure SSH passwordless login on application server (only allowing Key-based authentication)
#3
Change the port where the SSH daemon (sshd) listens to a different port (not 22)
#....
Use a bastion host only for access, install tools that block access (block IP Address) after too many tries, only allow access from specific IPs


# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the event that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

The best way to prevent access to the data in case of API compromisation is to have data encryption enabled. 
In that case even stolen data cannot be read without having the decryption key.

Another idea on how to achieve this is to cut off permissions of the IAM role c3-app-InstanceRole-BMUWXF8OYLV5 to only have access to specific (non secret) buckets.
Current configuration allows ALL Access to ALL Buckets.
